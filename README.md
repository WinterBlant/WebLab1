# [WebLab1](https://winterblant.github.io/WebLab1/)
A small web app for checking up the weather in your city.

## Used:
[handlebars.js](https://handlebars-draft.knappi.org/) - template engine

[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

## How to launch
* Clone the repo
* Open index.html
* Done!

## Editing
**style.sass** is the css preprocessor's file, which was compiled into simple css, so you may edit either of them. If you want to edit the *.sass* file, simply unzip the **dart-sass.7z** into the project, then open the terminal in project folder and type:

`sass preprocessfilename cssfilename`
