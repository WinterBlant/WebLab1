# [WebLab1](https://winterblant.github.io/WebLab1/)
A small web app for checking up the weather in your city.

## Used:
[d≈çmo](https://jed.github.io/domo/) - template engine

[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

## How to launch
* Clone the repo
* Open index.html
* Done!

## Editing
**index.js** is the main file, where all the html and js code is located. **style.sass** is the css preprocessor's file, which was compiled into simple css, so you may edit either of them.
